- Important functionality = get
- Also created tests + load factor tracking

3/7/17
- Added more unit tests
- Load factor checking more efficient (doesn't divide each time)
- Added copyHash and automatic resizing. Not entirely sure if it's spreading the keys out properly tho

5/7/17
- Added more unit tests + timing tests
- Fixed auto resizing, no mem leaks w/VALGRIND
- Added some python scripts
- Thinking about organising everything better

14/7/17
- Added more timing tests
- Perl script to test both
- Researching open addr
- Currently beating out python's dict but can be more optimised. (This was due to python rand)

23/7/17
- Currently ~10% slower than Python dict
- Added optimisations to modulus
- Change some conditionals to loops

25/7/17
- Adding open addr (put, free, createHash)
- Added some testing
