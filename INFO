Explaining what each program does

Basic unit tests

test.c = basic put and printHash test
unit_pg.c = unit tests for put and get (can't really test put w/o get)
collision.c = unit testing put and get w/ collision handling
resize.c = unit testing for resizing as the table enlarges (load factor = 0.75 DEFAULT)

Timing tests

time_insert.c, time_insert.py (C and Py equivalents of putting)
handler.pl = tests the two above
